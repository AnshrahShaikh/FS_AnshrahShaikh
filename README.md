The Student Commute Optimizer is a full-stack carpooling app for students. It uses a smart backend to match users with similar routes, shown on an interactive map. The app allows for secure, in-app chat, promoting ride-sharing to save money and reduce environmental impact.

Problem: Many students struggle to find and collaborate with peers on group projects due to limited communication channels and a lack of tools to coordinate schedules and tasks efficiently. This often leads to fragmented efforts, missed deadlines, and unequal workload distribution.

Solution: Develop a Peer Project Planner, a lightweight web or mobile application that helps students form project groups, assign tasks, and track progress in a single, easy-to-use platform. The app should include a shared calendar for scheduling meetings and a simple task-management board to ensure everyone is on the same page.
