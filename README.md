The Student Commute Optimizer is a full-stack carpooling app for students. It uses a smart backend to match users with similar routes, shown on an interactive map. The app allows for secure, in-app chat, promoting ride-sharing to save money and reduce environmental impact.
An attractive and functional UI for the Student Commute Optimizer should be clean, intuitive, and map-centric. The design focuses on a minimalist aesthetic to prevent clutter and make it easy for students to find and connect with each other.
